# Repo for replicating and extending [Awesome-Align](https://github.com/neulab/awesome-align/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file)
Motivation for reimplementation:
- their exisisting repo is difficult to make extentions on without effectively reorganizing the entire setup anyway.
- improve ease of experimentation with Hydra integration as well.
- provide organization for other extentions in terms of sentence and book level alignments
- allow for different models to be used other than just bert, as is shown to be effective in that one paper which used labse as an encoding model
- Ideally more easy to add losses and other settings than is currently.
